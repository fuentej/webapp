## 2. Core Features

VinSnitch will offer a tiered and modular set of features designed to cater to both individual consumers and automotive professionals. The features are built around the central theme of a detective agency, providing an engaging and intuitive user experience.

### 2.1. Surveillance Tier (“Neighborhood Watch”)

*   **What it does:** This is the introductory annual subscription service. It provides users with one full vehicle history report (referred to as a “Case File”), continuous recall and complaint monitoring for up to three specified vehicles, basic VIN decoding with vehicle specifications, and price-drop alerts for vehicles the user is actively watching. It also introduces the gamification elements, allowing users to earn “Detective Points” and badges.
*   **Why it’s important:** This tier serves as the entry point for users, offering significant value at an affordable price. It encourages initial engagement, introduces the core functionalities and the gamified environment, and provides a foundation for upselling more detailed investigative services. The monitoring features offer ongoing value, encouraging subscription renewal.
*   **How it works at a high level:** Upon subscription, users can input up to three Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs). The system decodes these VINs to provide basic specifications. One VIN can be selected for a full “Case File” generation. The system continuously monitors registered data sources for new recalls or consumer complaints related to the monitored VINs and alerts the user. Price drop alerts are triggered based on market data for watched vehicles. User actions within this tier contribute to their Detective Points.

### 2.2. Case File System (“Open a Case”)

*   **What it does:** This is a pay-as-you-go system for obtaining detailed vehicle history reports beyond the initial report included in the Surveillance Tier. It starts with a “Base Case” and allows users to add specialized “Agents” for deeper investigations into specific areas of a vehicle’s history.
*   **Why it’s important:** This modular approach allows users to customize the depth and cost of their vehicle investigation according to their specific needs and budget. It provides a clear path for upselling and revenue generation beyond the initial subscription, catering to users who require more than a basic overview.
*   **How it works at a high level:**
    *   **Base Case:** For a flat fee, users can initiate an investigation on any additional vehicle. This includes VIN verification, a title check (looking for salvage, flood, etc.), an odometer scan (checking for rollback discrepancies), and a summary of red flags.
    *   **Add “Agents” for Deeper Dives (Modular Add-ons):**
        *   **Accident Hunter:** This agent focuses on uncovering accident history, including police reports (where available) and damage estimates.
        *   **Paper Trail:** This agent delves into the ownership and lien history of the vehicle, tracing its registration and any outstanding financial claims.
        *   **Mechanic Mole:** This agent investigates the vehicle’s maintenance and service records, providing insights into its upkeep and identifying detailed recall information.
        *   **Market Insider:** This agent provides vehicle valuation data, including current market value and historical auction data, helping users understand its fair price.
        *   **Fraud Squad:** This agent specifically targets signs of sophisticated fraud, such as title washing (obscuring a vehicle's problematic history) and VIN cloning (assigning a legitimate VIN to a stolen or salvaged vehicle).

### 2.3. Gamified Engagement System

*   **What it does:** This system integrates game-like mechanics throughout the user experience to enhance engagement, encourage data contribution, and incentivize platform usage and referrals.
*   **Why it’s important:** Gamification aims to differentiate VinSnitch from competitors, increase user retention, drive upsells, and potentially create a viral growth loop. It makes the process of vehicle investigation more enjoyable and rewarding.
*   **How it works at a high level:**
    *   **Detective Points:** Users earn points for various activities such as logging their own vehicle maintenance, reporting claims they've experienced, referring new users (


Recruit new agents”), completing their user profiles, and renewing their Surveillance Tier subscription.
    *   **Redeem Points:** Accumulated Detective Points can be redeemed for tangible rewards such as free “Agent” add-ons for their Case Files, discounts on services or renewals, exclusive badges to display on their profile, and potentially branded merchandise (“swag”).
    *   **Ranks and Leaderboards:** Users can achieve different detective ranks based on their activity and points. Leaderboards (e.g., “Detective of the Month”) can foster friendly competition and community engagement.
