      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Core Infrastructure",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of each infrastructure component (Supabase, N8N, Fly.io, VPS for LLM) into detailed steps: provisioning, configuration, security, integration, monitoring, and documentation. Include environment setup, network configuration, and initial connectivity tests for each service.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves orchestrating multiple cloud and self-hosted services, each with unique configuration, security, and integration requirements. The dependencies between components and the need for robust testing and monitoring increase the complexity. More granular subtasks will help manage risk and ensure reliability."

      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand each authentication feature (registration, login, password management, OAuth, session handling) into backend, frontend, and security subtasks. Include detailed error handling, edge case testing, and documentation for each flow.",
      "reasoning": "User authentication is critical and must be secure, reliable, and user-friendly. While Supabase simplifies some aspects, integrating OAuth, session management, and robust error handling adds complexity. Additional subtasks will ensure coverage of security and usability concerns."
